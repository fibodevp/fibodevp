## About Me

Hi! I'm an aspiring developer with a growing interest in blockchain technology. Lately, I've been learning how to create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). My goal is to apply blockchain in real-world projects and deepen my understanding of this rapidly evolving field.

### What I Can Do:
- **Solidity**: I’m learning the basics of smart contract development and experimenting with simple token and contract implementations.
- **Ethereum**: I use the Ethereum test networks to deploy and debug my smart contracts.
- **dApps**: I’m working on integrating smart contracts with front-end applications using Web3.js.
- **Testing**: I’m practicing writing tests for contracts with tools like Truffle and Hardhat.

### What I’m Learning:
- Security best practices for smart contracts to avoid vulnerabilities.
- The growing field of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its impact on the blockchain ecosystem.
- Exploring different blockchain platforms like Polkadot and other Substrate-based projects.

I’m eager to learn and always open to new opportunities. Contributing to open-source projects is something I aim for as I continue building my blockchain development skills.
